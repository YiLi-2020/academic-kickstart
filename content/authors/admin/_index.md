I am a senior student at China Pharmaceutical University(CPU). In my first year, I was selected from 3000+ peer students for the Top-Notch Innovative Program, which gave undergraduates the chance to join the best groups of CPU. I worked in the Key Laboratory of Druggability of Biopharmaceuticals since then. 

My research focuses on drug delivery and currently I lead a project on constructing a smart nanoplatform using one drug as the carrier to deliver another drug.

Drug delivery is a highly multidisciplinary area. To me, it is just like playing LEGO-by organizing elements of different shapes and functions, we build brilliant gadgets. I enjoyed the process of implementing my ideas by hand and with nano “LEGO”, there is unlimited space for novel medicine revolutions-that is where the action is.
