  description = """Paclitaxel(PTX) is a famous anticancer agent but also brings multi-drug resistance(MDR) problem. Former studies confirmed that rod-shape nanoparticles, including PTX, enter cells via a non-lysosomal pathway, so why not use PTX as the carrier to deliver an agent that can reverse MDR?
  
 ·Designed experiments and optimized conditions with the help of Design Expert.
 ·Studied binding mechanism based on component analysis and characterization.
 ·Cultured PTX-resistant cells and studied cytotoxicity, uptake and distribution, etc.
 ·Confirmed the non-lysosomal pathway.
 ·Undertook a research project independently."""

  description = "We set a interdisciplinary team of 5 student for the Student Entrepreneurship Competition Program to study chemoimmunotherapy for Pulmonary Hypertension. Time and funds were too limited to develop a novel active agent, so we used Baicalein extracted for the Chinese herb, which could reduce vascular resistance according Compendium of Materia Medica, and combined with p53 pathway to induce apoptosis."
