  Paclitaxel(PTX) is a famous anticancer agent but also brings multi-drug resistance(MDR) problem. Former studies confirmed that rod-shape nanoparticles, including PTX, enter cells via a non-lysosomal pathway, so why not use PTX as the carrier to deliver an agent that can reverse MDR?

·Designed experiments and optimized conditions with the help of Design Expert.

·Studied binding mechanism based on component analysis and characterization.

·Cultured PTX-resistant cells and studied cytotoxicity, uptake and distribution, etc.

·Confirmed the non-lysosomal pathway. 

·Undertook a research project independently.

  Inspired by a story from the Art of War, which documented that an ancient general blocked his enemies in a city an then defeated them as a whole, we use marimastat‐loaded thermosensitive liposomes to protect the integrity of microenvironment, and then inject PTX Ns to induce apoptosis.
  
·Participated in literature reviewing and made hypotheses.

·Prepared and characterized nanoparticles.

·Studied on pharmacodynamics, and build pharmacokinetics models.

·Drew diagram of mechanism and wrote part of the article.

·Experienced an entire research process.

  Using different carrier to deliver PTX we got very different cell uptake and distribution, so what led to the differences? How to improve delivery efficacy?
  
·Designed and prepared nanoparticle using model protein and drug.

·Set experiments to control different morphology parameter of nanoparticles.

·Studied the mechanism of endocytosis and intracellular distribution.

·Acquired the ability to operate most lab equipments and workshops.

Time and funds were too limited to develop a novel active agent, so we used Baicalein, extracted from the a Chinese herb, to reduce vascular resistance.

·Presided over the preliminary work, including project planning, carrier design, etc.

·Established pulmonary embolism in a rat model and studied the anti-PAH efficacy.

·Collected and processed biological samples to do pharmacokinetics studies.

·Presented achievements by analyzing data and diagrams, and passed the defence.
